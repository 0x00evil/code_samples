Include the module in a class, and the methods become instance methods
of the class. If you include a module into a class while you're in
another module, you'll have to use the send method. E.g.

  base.send(:include, InstanceMethods)

Include the module in the eigenclass of a class (via extend, inside the
module), and the methods become class methods

  base.extend(ClassMethods)
    -or if the desired class methods are in the same module-
  base.extend(self) 

Include the module in the eigenclass of any generic object, and the
methods become Singleton Methods of the object

  obj = String.new
  obj.extend(MyModule)
